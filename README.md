# LSB-IMAGE-STEGNOGRAPHY-IN-C
LSB image steganography is a technique that hides secret data within an image by modifying the least significant bit of each pixel, causing minimal visible change to the image. This method allows covert communication by embedding information imperceptibly into the image pixels' binary values.
